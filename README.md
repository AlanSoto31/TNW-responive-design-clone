![screenshot](Images/screenshot.png)

It is a clone from the home page but including fully responsive design. One very important requisite for this project was set 2 breakpoints to media queries, it was necessary to found them on the original page, which was a great opportunity to see how responsive design works. These 2 breakpoints are 768px - 1024px, the most responsive design happens inside this range but there are some special details happening at 1113px and 1200px in navbar.
